#+Title: FacePattern

This is the pipeline I wrote for my Master Thesis in the Prevedel group at EMBL. It aims at extracting stereotyped patterns of facial movements from simple b/w webcam recordings of head-fixed mice.

** TODO Open Todos
   1. [ ] Find a more objective way to determine the number of clusters per video
      + currently, the number is determined after smoothing a tSNE plot of HOG vectors with a Gaussian kernel with the heuristic \sigma of 1.8
   2. [ ] Enable the option to work on videos that don't have changing grayscale values in the eye (i.e. no IR laser recording of neural activity)
